## Autobooting

Autobooting can be configured in the `[boot]` section in [minute/minute.ini](config_example/minute.ini). Set `autoboot` to the number (starting at 1) of the menu entry you want to autoboot. 0 disables autobooting. A timeout in seconds can be set with the `autoboot_timeout` option (default is 3).

If no SD card is inserted, minute was loaded from SLC and the `slc:/sys/hax/ios_plugins` directory exists minute will try autobooting from SLC (first option in minute).

When a IOSU reload happens, minute will automatically boot the last booted option again, to disable this behavior set `autoreload=false` in the `[boot]` section.

## Drive Power

On a stock system boot1 turns on the power to the Disc Drive (ODD), just before it boots the IOS. With minute and stroopwafel we introduce an additional stage and with that a delay. The disc drive makes noise at two points in the boot process: Once when it's power gets enabled and once when the SATA connection gets initialized. On a stock system this delay is so short that the first (power) drive initialization / noise is immediately interrupted by the second one (SATA). The delay caused by minute + stroopwafel makes causes it to be two noticeable separate noises.

To avoid this as much as possible, the minute boot1 (from minute 2.10 and on)(which is also part of ISFSHax 5.1 and on and takes over before the stock boot1 initializes the drive) does not turn on the drive power and minute waits until the last possible moment for turning on the drive power. Stroopwafel was optimized to not output anything on the debug port, since that was adding noticeable delay. This is close to the stock behavior.

To get totally rid of the first noise minute now has the option to set `odd_power=false` in the `[boot]` section of `minute.ini` (default is true). When set to false, minute does not turn on the ODD power. And IOSU will turn on the power, just before it initializes the SATA connection. But on some consoles this causes a crash on cold boot after being off for several hours. The reason for that crash is not fully clear, but it is assumed that enabling the power causes some power instability, which is more critical in IOSU with more of the system (like the PPC) running.

## LED color

The LED color can be configured in with `blue_led_after_minute` in the `[boot]` section of `minute.ini` (default is true). When set to false, the LED will be kept purple after exiting minute.

## Fastboot variants
Since the fastboot version ignores all configuration files, multiple variants can be built and are provided in the releases configured with different combinations of settings (corresponding to ones available in `minute.ini`).  
Currently available settings are `ODD_POWER` and `BLUE_LED_AFTER_MINUTE`.

## Building

To build you need [devkitPPC](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) installed.

- Build `boot1.img`: `make -f Makefile.boot1`
- Build `fw.img`: `make`
- Build `fw_fastboot.img` (with default settings): `make -f Makefile.fastboot`
- Build `isfshax_stage2.elf`: `make -f Makefile.isfshax`

To build a variant of `fw_fastboot.img` with different settings, specify them at the end of the `make` command (for example, `make -f Makefile.fastboot ODD_POWER=0 BLUE_LED_AFTER_MINUTE=0`). Default settigns can be found at the beginning of `Makefile.fastboot`.

### Building using Docker/Podman

It's possible to use a docker image for building. This way you don't need anything installed on your host system.

```bash
# Build docker image (only needed once)
podman build . -t minute-builder

# Build everything
podman run --rm -v ${PWD}:/project minute-builder /bin/bash -c "make -f Makefile.boot1 && make && make -f Makefile.fastboot"

# Clean (Note: only cleans the default build and elfloader)
podman run --rm -v ${PWD}:/project minute-builder /bin/bash -c "make -f Makefile.boot1 clean && make clean && make -f Makefile.fastboot clean
```

## redNAND

redNAND allows replacing one or more of the Wii Us internal storage devices (SLCCMPT, SLC, MLC) with partitions on the SD card. redNAND is implemented in stroopwafel, but configured through minute. The SLC and SLCCMPT partition are without the ECC/HMAC data. \
To prepare an SD card for usage with minute you can either use the `Format redNAND` option in the `Backup and Restore` menu or partition the SD card manually on the PC.

### Format redNAND

The `Format redNAND` option will erase the FAT32 partition and recreate it smaller to make room for the redNAND partitions. If it is already small enough it won't be touched. All other partitions will get deleted and the three redNAND partitions will be created and the content of the real devices will be cloned to them.

### Partition manually

You don't need all three partitions, only the ones you intend to redirect. The first partition in the MBR (not necessarily the physical order) needs to be the FAT32 partition. The order of the redNAND partitions doesn't matter, as long as they are not the first one. Only primary partitions are supported. The purpose of the partition is identified by it's ID (file system type).
The types are:

- SLCCMPT: `0x0D`
- SLC: `0x0E` (FAT16 with LBA)
- MLC (needs SCFM): `0x83` (Linux ext2/ext3/ext4)
- MLC (no SCFM): `0x07` (NTFS)

Windows Disk Mangement doesn't support multiple partitions on SD cards, so you need to use a third party tool like Minitool Partition Wizard. The SLC partitions need to be exactly 512MiB (1048576 Sectors). If you want to write a SLC.RAW image form minute or and slc.bin from the nanddumper to it, you first need to strip the ECC data from it. If you want to use an exiting MLC image of a 32GB console, the MLC Partition needs to be exactly 60948480 sectors.

### SCFM

SCFM is a block level write cache for the MLC which resides on the SLC. This creates a coupling between to SLC and the MLC, which needs to be consistent at all times. You can not restore one without the other. This also means using the red MLC with the sys SLC or the other way around is not allowed unless explicitly enabled to prevent damage to the sys nand. \
MLC only redirection is still possible by disabling SCFM. But that requires a MLC, which is consistent without SCFM. There are two ways to archive that. Either [rebuid a fresh MLC](https://gbatemp.net/threads/how-to-upgrading-rebuilding-wii-u-internal-memory-mlc.636309/) on the redNAND partition or use a MLC Dump which was obtained through the [recovery_menu](https://github.com/jan-hofmeier/recovery_menu/releases). Format the Partition to NTFS before writing the backup to change the ID to the correct type. The MLC clone obtained by the `Format redNAND` option requires SCFM, same for the mlc.bin obtained by the original nanddumper.

### OTP

If a file `redotp.bin` is found on the SD card, it will be used instead of the real otp / otp.bin (for defuse). OTP redirection requires redirection of SLC, SLCCMPT and MLC.

### SEEPROM

SEEPROM redirection works similar to the OTP redirection, it looks for `redseeprom.bin`. If IOSU changes the SEEPROM, the changes won't be written back to the file and will be lost on reboot. The disc drive key is not redirected and is still read from the real SEEPROM.

### redNAND configuration

redNAND is configured by the [sd:/minute/rednand.ini](config_example/rednand.ini) config file.
In the `partitions` section you configure which redNAND partitions should be used. You can omit partitions that you don't want to use, but minute will warn about omitted if the partition exists on the SD. \
In the `scfm` section you configure the SCFM options. `disable` will disable the SCFM, which is required for MLC only redirection. Minute will also check if the type of the MLC partition matches this setting. The `allow_sys` allows configurations that would make your sys scfm inconsistent. This option is strongly discouraged and can will lead to corruption and data loss on the sys nand if you don't know what you are doing.
It is also possible to disable the encryption for the MLC redNAND partition using the `disable_encryption` option.
The system MLC can be mounted as a USB device, to exchange data between sysNAND and redNAND.
